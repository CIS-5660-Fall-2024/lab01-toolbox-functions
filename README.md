Practicing toolbox functions making "Flowers" on shadertoy!

# Graphics

1. Pulsing Flower

Manipulated radius using cosine function, with timing modified using bias function.

2. Spinning Flower

Manipulated radius with a triangle wave. Was unable to get the "shrinking" part of the animation working how I wanted to, however.

3. Custom Flower

Combined the other two solutions, with different periods for their radius expansion/contraction, and modulated the flower color with a gradient that changed over time
